## Why donate to Organic Maps?

1. We rely on your donations to carry out our mission to keep Organic Maps open and free.
   And free from ads.
2. We are a few enthusiasts contributing in our free time, and spending our families' money on the project.
   We love what we do, and we love our users ❤️.
3. With your support, we want to become a better, privacy-focused version of Google Maps.

## What will the money be used for?

1. We pay for fast servers, so anyone in the World can download free map data updates without delays.
   It's hundreds of terabytes monthly, and the amount is growing.
2. User support, bugfixing, and improving the stability of the app are at the top of our priorities.
   There are [1800+ issues on GitHub][github issues], and this number is growing every day.
   AppStore, Google Play, and support emails are overflooded with comments and bugs. We want to deliver a high-quality product.
3. With enough money, new features can be developed faster, for example:
   - Weekly and automated map data updates
   - Bookmarks backup and sync
   - Android Auto
   - GPS track recorder with GPX support
   - Better map styles for different activities
   - Hill shading and 3D terrain
   - Improve the OpenStreetMap editor
   - Better offline address search, routing, and navigation
   - Public Transport
   - … and [many other][github issues] features you want and love
