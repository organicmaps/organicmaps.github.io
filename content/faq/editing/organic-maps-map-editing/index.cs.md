With Organic Maps, you can easily add missing places to the map, add additional details like opening hours, or fix wrong entries. By doing this, you improve the map data for all users.

As [OpenStreetMap(OSM)](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/About_OpenStreetMap) is the primary source of map data in Organic Maps, the edits you make are sent to OSM. OSM is a community project to build a free and open map. It works similarly to Wikipedia, so everything you edit becomes available to millions of users all over the world. Join the community and help to make a better map for everyone!

**To edit OpenStreetMap from your Organic Maps app:**

1. Create an account at [OpenStreetMap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new)
2. Log into your account in Organic Maps (burger icon -> _settings_ -> _OpenStreetMap-Profile_)
3. Now you can edit existing places or add new ones
   - Edit existing place
     - select the place by taping on the map icon
     - tap _edit place_
     - Add additional information
     - Save your changes and exit using the check arrow
   - Add a place to the map
     - burger icon -> _Add a place to the OpenStreetMap_
     - Select the location as accurately as you can and press the check arrow
     - Select a category
       > Can't find a category that fits? Then create an [OSM Note](@/faq/editing/advanced-map-editing/index.md#osm-note).
     - Add additional information like the name, opening hours, and website
     - Save your changes and exit using the check arrow

Note that the editor is designed as a simple POI editor and, therefore, limited to POIs. You can, e.g., not add roads, lakes, building outlines, etc. Moreover moving places to a new location is not possible. If you can't edit something with Organic Maps, take a look at the [More advanced map editing](@/faq/editing/advanced-map-editing/index.md) page.
