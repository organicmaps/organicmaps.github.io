您可以导入从 Organic Maps 或第三方应用发送的以 KML、KMZ、KMB、GPX 格式导出的书签：

To import a single file:

1. Locate shared KML, KMZ, KMB, GPX file with bookmarks sent by email, instant messenger or cloud storage, for example, iCloud or Google Drive.

2. 轻触一次或长按带有书签的 KML、KMZ、KMB、GPX 文件，并在弹出窗口中选择“使用 Organic Maps 打开”（安卓）或“在 Organic Maps 中导入”（iOS）。

3. 将会在 Organic Maps 中打开，您将看到书签成功加载的提示。您可以在地图上或在书签菜单屏幕中找到它们。 You can find them on the map or in Bookmarks Menu screen.

Importing bookmarks and tracks in batch is also possible:

1. Open Organic Maps and tap star button to open list of bookmarks and tracks. Push "Import Bookmarks and Tracks" button.

2. Select a folder with KML, KMZ, KMB, GPX files. Organic Maps will scan it including subfolders and import all supported files with bookmarks and tracks. You can choose root folder to search over all storage.
