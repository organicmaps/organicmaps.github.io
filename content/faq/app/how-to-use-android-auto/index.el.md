To use OM with Android Auto, you need at least an Android version 8.0 (Oreo) or later. Moreover you need to download Organic Maps from the Google Play Store as Google only allows Google approved apps on Android Auto.

Please check the [Android Auto website](https://www.android.com/auto/) for further details.
