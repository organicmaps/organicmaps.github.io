On Android, if you store your maps on an SD card, the most likely cause is a faulty SD card. You can:

1. Delete all downloaded maps and re-download them again to the SD card (may not work again).
2. Delete all downloaded maps, select Internal device storage, and re-download maps.
3. Format SD card and re-download maps.
4. Buy a new SD card (recommended)

If the app still crashes, please check [our GitHub](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/issues/) for similar issues, and [contact us](mailto:support@organicmaps.app) and provide the following:

- A detailed description of the issue and steps to reproduce it
- Organic Maps version
- Device model and OS version (Android or iOS)
