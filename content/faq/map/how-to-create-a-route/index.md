Once your location is determined on the map, choose your destination.
You can use one of the following ways:

* tap the search button
* tap the bookmarks button
* tap any place on the map

Once you have chosen point of destination, press “Route to” button at the bottom. The route will be created and you will see distance and estimated travel time. You can change the route type by pressing the Car, Pedestrian, Subway, Bike or Ruler icon at the top of the screen. To start following the route tap “Start” button. Press the arrow sign in the lower right corner of the screen and tap Stop to finish the route.

You can choose a different starting point (“Route From“ button) to preview a route, but navigation is only available from your current location.

You can add up to 100 intermediate points to a route. To add an intermediate point, create a route between the start and destination, then tap a point on the map (or select it from bookmarks/using the search) and tap “Add stop”.

You can change the settings of the car route and select road types that you would like to avoid (tolls, unpaved roads, motorways, ferries). Open the app settings → Routing options → Toggle On needed options. Avoid options are also displayed when the route is built if changing any of the options may change the route.
