Your download can fail due to a temporary network error or specific network provider/router settings (firewall blocking). Please try again later or use a different Wi-Fi access point. In addition, make sure that you have enough free space to download maps.

Also, if you have very outdated maps and the app can't update them, deleting outdated maps and re-downloading them may help.
