Most likely you configured to store maps data on SD card. Usually switchable SD cards in Android phones are slow and unreliable.

Change Organic Maps config to store maps data in internal storage. Open Settings → Save maps to → Internal private storage.

Or you can replace SD card with faster one to improve map performance.
