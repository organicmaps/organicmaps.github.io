This release was delayed due to [OpenStreetMap vandalism](https://community.openstreetmap.org/t/vandalism-and-blocks-in-israel/105176), and due to a longer testing of many fixes and changes prepared by our contributors.

Highlights
* New OpenStreetMap data as of November 13, 2023
* It is possible to zoom in deeper now and see more POIs in dense areas
* Outdoors map style preview (please read on to know how to activate it)
* Added an experimental referral link "Details on Kayak" for some hotels that are already present in OpenStreetMap. Booking a hotel using this link will give a few dollars to Organic Maps as a donation toward the project development. This is not expected to bring in much, but every dollar counts. Remember, that Organic Maps doesn’t collect or share any information about you or your device. Please be aware that Kayak may have tracking on their website like most other websites, including Facebook and Twitter.
