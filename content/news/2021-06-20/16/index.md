There are already many requests from users to add public transport support. It would be great to start using that existing OpenStreetMap data and add/update transport schedules directly from the app. For anyone interested to volunteer, there is also a good starting point here: <https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/blob/master/docs/EXPERIMENTAL%5FPUBLIC%5FTRANSPORT%5FSUPPORT.md>
