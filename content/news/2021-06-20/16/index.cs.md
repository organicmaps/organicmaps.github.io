There are already many requests from users to add public transport support.
It would be great to start using that existing OpenStreetMap data and add/update transport schedules directly from the app.
For anyone interested to volunteer, there is also a good starting point [here](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/blob/master/docs/EXPERIMENTAL%5FPUBLIC%5FTRANSPORT%5FSUPPORT.md).
