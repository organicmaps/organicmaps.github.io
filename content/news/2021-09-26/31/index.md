Here is the list of OpenStreetMap metro/subways validation results:

or

You can help us by fixing red metro lines directly in OpenStreetMap. Then every [@OrganicMaps](https://t.me/OrganicMaps) user will have an updated Public Transport map (subways and S-Bahn at the moment).

Some general instructions are here:
