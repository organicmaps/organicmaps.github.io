A short announcement before the details about the September Organic Maps release.
We are looking for volunteers to help us in different areas. A lot of interesting and challenging work (did you already check [1800+ issues on Github](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/issues/)? 💪) awaits on the open-source, community-built road to the best, fastest 🚀, easy-to-use 👴 👵 🧒, and privacy-focused maps. Want to [help us ](https://organicmaps.app/support-us/)with the app and website development, marketing, PR, financing, user support, or in any other way? Say hello@organicmaps.app.

If we get enough money, we can significantly speed up the development by hiring a full-time team and rewarding the most active contributors. If we get more users, we get more donations. [Donate](https://organicmaps.app/donate/) and spread the word 💸! Let's call it **Organic Crowdfunding** 💰

Several new features are available in the September update. You can easily measure distance and build straight-line routes in the same way as you are building other routes, and even simpler, with a single tap! We called it Helicopter Routing but then decided to rename into the Ruler to avoid confusion.
Another new Android feature is background voice directions. Now Organic Maps can talk with you from your pocket 🙂

* New OSM maps data as of September 20
* Added new route type "Ruler" (aka Helicopter Routing) to measure straight distances quickly, many thanks to Sergiy [@strump](https://github.com/strump) for bringing it to life!
* Set decimal and grouping separators depending on the system locale, thanks to Gonzalo [@gpesquero](https://github.com/gpesquero)
* Removed annoying zoom in route planning mode

Map styling was done mostly by Konstantin [@pastk](https://github.com/pastk), David [@dvdmrtnz](https://github.com/dvdmrtnz), Harry [@RedAuburn](https://github.com/RedAuburn), and [@map-per](https://github.com/map-per):
* New or updated icons for factory, winery, bookcase, library, brothel, bicycle repair station, bicycle rental, bicycle parking, sauna, lottery, bookmaker, massage, sewing, books, underground parking, disabled parking space, gate, excrement bags vending, wholesale shop, outdoor seating, handicraft, grinding mill, caterer, HVAC, key cutter and locksmith. That's a long list, huh?

Even longer list!
* Added bridges and tunnels rendering for cycleways, footways, paths, tracks, bridleways, steps

* Tuned road names and road shield priorities
* Fixed icons display for parking buildings

* Pedestrian tunnels are not visible in navigation mode

We are infinitely grateful to everyone who [helps us](https://organicmaps.app/support-us/) and [donates](https://organicmaps.app/donate/). Organic Maps would not be possible without our users and our contributors ♥️ 🙏 🤟
