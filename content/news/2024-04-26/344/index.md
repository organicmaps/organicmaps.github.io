### Travel with Organic Maps song

{{ audio(title="Travel with Organic Maps", url="/news/2024-04-26/travel-with-organic-maps-song/Travel with Organic Maps.mp3") }}

<pre>
(Verse 1)
Beneath the twinkling stars, I stroll hand in hand,
With Organic Maps, exploring enchanted lands.
From Eiffel's gentle glow to Iceland's black sand shore,
Every step a melody, every sight, pure amore.

(Verse 2)
Through Rome's timeless Colosseum, echoes of history's might,
And Egypt's majestic pyramids, kissing the sun's light.
Organic Maps, a faithful guide, whispers tales of yore,
In its embrace, I find solace, forevermore.

(Chorus)
Travel with Organic Maps, a symphony of peace,
From OpenStreetMap's embrace, all worries cease.
Crafted with love, by volunteers' tender care,
Every destination, a moment rare.

(Outro)
So let's dance along, in this magical flight,
With Organic Maps, our hearts take flight.
In every corner of this earth we roam,
With Organic Maps, we'll always find home.
</pre>
