Finally, iPad users can use their keyboards without Organic Maps freezing, and Android users can enjoy reading Wiki articles for bookmarked places 😉 We've also improved the search function, particularly for users who search by categories. Specifically, we've separated vegan and vegetarian cuisine searches 🌱and added some new POI types, such as psychotherapist, speech therapist, audiologist, and blood donation center, which were previously grouped under one 'healthcare' tag.

Here's a complete list of what's new in this version, which is available in the [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/app/organic-maps/id1567437057), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.organicmaps), [FDroid](https://f-droid.org/packages/app.organicmaps/), [Huawei AppGallery](https://appgallery.huawei.com/#/app/C104325611):
