A hotfix Android release (May 31) is available in stores:
* Fixed disappearing of downloaded maps files bug introduced in the last release.
If you were affected, please open "Save maps to" in OM settings and switch to "Internal private storage" (with a /data/data/... path). Then tap OK to move maps, and all your disappeared maps will be back shortly! After that, you can switch to a storage option of your choice.
* Fixed crash for some routes.
* Do not draw place=region on the World map.

Please see [previous release](https://organicmaps.app/news/2022-05-24/meet-the-may-organic-maps-update/) notes for more details.
