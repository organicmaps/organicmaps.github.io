Checking in at SOTM EU 2023 in Antwerp. Organic Maps (OM) would not be possible without the OpenStreetMap (OSM) community. Thanks to everyone who volunteers and improves the Map!

We aim to create easy-to-use maps for everyone on the Planet while respecting privacy and keeping the code open. It is hard to do alone, so we are looking for motivated community members who can lead the development of the complex features (better OSM editor, Public Transport, traffic info, user-generated content, and many more), help with scaling app support, and promote OpenStreetMap and Organic Maps. The more users know about OM, the more users know about OSM. More OSM contributors mean better quality map data for everyone. That's a win-win!

P.S. The app update is coming soon, please stay tuned!
