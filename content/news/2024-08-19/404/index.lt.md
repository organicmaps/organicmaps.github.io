The new August release was delayed by an unexpected [removal](https://organicmaps.app/news/2024-08-17/last-night-organic-maps-was-removed-from-the-play-store-without-any-warnings-or-additional-details-due-to-not-meeting-the-requirements-for-the-family-program/) of Organic Maps from the Google Play Store.
Luckily, the issue was [resolved](https://organicmaps.app/news/2024-08-18/good-news-organic-maps-appeared-again-in-the-google-play-store/) in one day. Thanks to everyone who supports us!

You can download and install Organic Maps from [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/app/organic-maps/id1567437057), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.organicmaps), [Huawei AppGallery](https://appgallery.huawei.com/#/app/C104325611), [Obtainium](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/wiki/Installing-Organic-Maps-from-GitHub-using-Obtainium) or [FDroid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/app.organicmaps/).

Note two important issues to be fixed soon:

1. Add Place (Add Business) button is not shown when a building is selected (use a single tap instead of a long tap to select any random point on the map).
