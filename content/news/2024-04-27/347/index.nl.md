### The anthem of community-driven privacy and freedom

{{ audio(title="The anthem of community-driven privacy and freedom", url="/news/2024-04-27/organic-maps-privacy-and-freedom-anthem-driven-by-community/The Organic Maps Anthem of community-driven privacy and freedom.mp3") }}

<pre>(Verse 1)
Organic Maps, no tracking in sight,
Community-driven, with privacy right.
No ads, no traps, just maps with flair,
Navigate with freedom, we're beyond compare.

(Chorus)
No tracking! No crapware! No pesticides!
Organic Maps, where freedom resides!
Navigate with privacy, feel the vibe,
Community-driven, let's take the ride.

(Verse 2)
Open-source, no data grab,
Offline maps, with trails to nab.
Cycling routes, hiking trails, all in view,
Voice guidance, privacy true.

(Chorus)
No tracking! No crapware! No pesticides!
Organic Maps, where freedom resides!
Navigate with privacy, feel the vibe,
Community-driven, let's take the ride.

(Bridge)
Blazing fast, privacy intact,
Simple to use, that's a fact.
No tracking, just maps so clear,
Navigate with Organic, have no fear.

(Outro)
Try us out, see what's in store,
Freedom's our motto, now and forevermore.
Organic Maps, leading the way,
Navigate with privacy, every day.
</pre>
