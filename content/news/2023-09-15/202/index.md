We are looking for someone (or for a team) experienced with zola (or hugo) static website generators to improve [our current website](https://organicmaps.app/) for mobiles and desktops. There are many tasks there from redesign to adding new sections, languages and translations. Please let us know if you are interested at hello@organicmaps.app

The source code of the current website is [available on Github](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps.github.io/).

Planned improvements are also there [in the issues list](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps.github.io/issues/), we will update it with more details soon.
