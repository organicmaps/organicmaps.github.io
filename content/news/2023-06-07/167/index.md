GPX import is now supported in Organic Maps! You don't need to convert your GPX tracks into KML anymore.

Many thanks to [@cyber-toad](https://github.com/cyber-toad), who patiently fixed all our review comments, polished and finished the code started by [dvdmrtnz](https://github.com/dvdmrtnz).
And, of course, kudos ❤️ to all our users, community, and contributors who [support us](https://organicmaps.app/support-us/) in many different ways. We can build the best maps together!

Get Organic Maps in the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/organic-maps/id1567437057), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.organicmaps), and [Huawei AppGallery](https://appgallery.huawei.com/#/app/C104325611).
The [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/app.organicmaps/) build, as usual, fails, but we hope it will be fixed soon.
