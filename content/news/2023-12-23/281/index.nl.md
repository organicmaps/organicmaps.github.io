In 2023 Organic Maps got its **first million users**. It would not be possible to scale without the help from our beloved community. A million thanks for your energy and time, your [donations](https://organicmaps.app/donate/) and [support](https://organicmaps.app/support-us/) üôè ‚ù§Ô∏è üçÉ

In 2023:

- New features were added, including GPX import, Ruler tool, Outdoors map style, Background voice directions, Android Auto (in Google's review now), and others (see our [news](https://organicmaps.app/news/) for details)
- 15 app updates and hotfixes were released
- A lot of improvements for the search and routing, map icons and styles, and general usability
- 4.6 average rating on Google Play from 7,372 users
- 4.8 rating on the AppStore from 2717 users
- 1992 commits from 167 contributors [on Github](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/)
- 960 merged Pull Requests
- 724 closed issues (almost [2000 open issues](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/issues/) left to fix/implement üí™)
- Total 7710 stars on GitHub
- More than a thousand support emails were answered
- Almost [9K edits and map contributions](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Editor%5Fusage%5Fstats) in OpenStreetMap

It's possible to do even more in 2024 if we get enough [donations](https://organicmaps.app/donate/) to scale the infrastructure, reward our contributors, or hire a full-time working team.
One of our goals is to provide a privacy-focused map alternative to Google and Apple Maps. Another goal is to educate and engage more users in contributing to [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org/). Good map quality means happier hikers, cyclists, drivers, locals, tourists, and explorers. Happier everyone!
