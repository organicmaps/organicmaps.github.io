We are looking for volunteers who can help us to prepare and [translate Whats New](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/pull/4326) for upcoming releases for all app stores and for our website on a more or less regular basis. Or for any other ways to help us speed up the translation process not only for Whats New, but also for other texts. Any ideas and help are appreciated! Want to peek at the [full list](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps.github.io/pull/95) of changes?

The full list of languages is available [here](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9844778?rd=1#zippy=%2Cview-list-of-available-languages) for Android and [here](https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/dev997f9cf7c) for iOS. We can add all languages to our website (its other pages are translated now using Weblate).

Drop us an email if you are interested at support@organicmaps.app
