It was a busy time for our team and our beloved contributors. We prepared a new app and map data update for you.
Also, this year, Organic Maps got 4 slots in the Google Summer of Code 2023 program, for the following features:

1. Android Auto.
2. Better user interface for mobile and desktop Linux, Mac, and Windows (Windows still require some. porting to build and run OM)
3. Wikipedia parser to get fresh Wikipedia articles (now we use outdated dump as of spring 2022).
4. Better map styling system to support Outdoor, Cycling, Driving, Tourism, and other custom layers.

We hope that our students will manage to finish their tasks this year and make Organic Maps better.

As always, please let us know about bugs and issues in the app, and fix all map-related issues at [OpenStreetMap.org](https://openstreetmap.org/)
