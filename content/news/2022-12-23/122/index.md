We wish you a Merry Christmas 🎅 and a Happy New Year 🎄! The best gift for us is to know that we are doing The Right Thing and that our time and efforts are helping someone on the Planet 🌎. Meet our small gift 🎁 to you: a New Year's release of Organic Maps is available in [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/app/organic-maps/id1567437057), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.organicmaps), Huawei [AppGallery](https://appgallery.huawei.com/#/app/C104325611?local=en), and [FDroid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/app.organicmaps/)!

We have to fix a lot of issues and implement many features ([1200+ on our GitHub](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/issues) at the moment). Many of them are about improving the app. Some features are more complex and can be done as separate, independent open projects. For example, places photos and [reviews](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/issues/2758), [road traffic](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/issues/1160) database, [public transport](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/issues/837) service, [cloud sync and backup](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/issues/2082), online maps, web editor for trip planning, map styles editor, [travel guides](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/issues/3648), API/SDK for other apps, etc. Here you can help by [donating](https://organicmaps.app/donate/), participating, or even leading such a project!

The main goal of the [Organic Maps](https://organicmaps.app/) project is to create an open and privacy-friendly alternative to existing proprietary maps. With your [donations](https://organicmaps.app/donate/), help, and [support](https://organicmaps.app/support-us/), we can reach this goal sooner while providing all services for free to everyone. Also, please let us know if you are aware of any grants that may help with the development of Organic Maps. For example, [this](https://prototypefund.de/) grant can be used by contributors in Germany.
