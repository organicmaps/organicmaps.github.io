As we're working now on the Recent Track for Android and Track Recorder for iOS and Android, it would be great to hear your real use-cases, where and why do you need it, in more details. And how to make these features in the easiest-to-use way, so even your grandma and grandpa can use them.

The best ideas and examples from other apps are also welcome. Any feedback in our [Telegram][], [Matrix][] or by [email](mailto:support@organicmaps.app) is appreciated ❤️❤️❤️
