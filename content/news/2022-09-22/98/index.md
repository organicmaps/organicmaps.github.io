As some of you have already discovered, a new September update of Organic Maps is already available in [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/app/organic-maps/id1567437057), [AppGallery](https://appgallery.huawei.com/#/app/C104325611), and [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/app.organicmaps/).
Google Play update is delayed because we hot-fixed a few interface-related issues. Hopefully, it will also be available in the upcoming days!

The coolest change is a fresh new look for Android (kudos to [Arnaud Vergnet](https://github.com/arnaudvergnet) and [all other contributors](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/graphs/contributors?from=2021-05-17&amp;to=2022-09-22&amp;type=c)!), but let's check the full list of changes (and don’t forget to [support us](https://organicmaps.app/support-us/) in many ways, including [donations](https://organicmaps.app/donate/)):
