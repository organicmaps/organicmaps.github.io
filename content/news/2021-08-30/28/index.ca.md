With the help of our community ❤️, in the 21.08.26 update we:

- Increased maximum number of intermediate stops from 3 to... try to guess 🙂
- Fixed rare crash when downloading maps
- Made farmlands more visible on the map
- Updated 🇧🇷 Brazil and 🇵🇹 Portuguese translations

On Android, in addition:

- Finally, maps download should work for everyone! You don't need to enable Internet access for Download Manager anymore!
- Bookmark button ⭐ shows "Save" and "Delete" instead of just "Bookmark"
