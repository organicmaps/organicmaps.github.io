**Organic Maps** is a free Android & iOS offline maps app for travelers, tourists, hikers, drivers and cyclists based on **\[OpenStreetMap]\[openstreetmap]** data created by the community.
It is a privacy-focused, open-source [fork][fork] of **Maps.me** app (previously known as \[**MapsWithMe**]\[mapswithme]), maintained by the same people who created **MapsWithMe** in 2011.

**Organic Maps** is one of the few applications nowadays that supports 100% of features without an active Internet connection. Install Organic Maps, download maps, throw away your SIM card, and go for a weeklong trip on a single battery charge without any byte sent to the network.

> In 2023, Organic Maps [got its first million](@/news/2023-12-23/281/index.md) users. [Help us](@/donate/index.md) to scale!
