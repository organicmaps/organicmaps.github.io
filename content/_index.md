**Organic Maps** is a free Android & iOS offline maps app for travelers, tourists, hikers, and cyclists based on top of crowd-sourced **[OpenStreetMap][openstreetmap]** data. It is a privacy-focused, open-source [fork][fork] of **Maps.me** app (previously known as [**MapsWithMe**][mapswithme]), maintained by the same people who created **MapsWithMe** in 2011.

**Organic Maps** is one of a few applications nowadays that supports 100% of features without an active Internet connection. Install Organic Maps, download maps, throw away your SIM card (by the way, your operator constantly tracks you), and go for a weeklong trip on a single battery charge without any byte sent to the network.

### Download and install Organic Maps from [AppStore][appstore], [Google Play][googleplay], [FDroid][fdroid], [Huawei AppGallery][appgallery] {#install}
