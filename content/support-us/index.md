Organic Maps is a free, open-source app. It is free from ads, it does not collect your personal information,
and it is developed by enthusiasts with the help of the community.

There are different ways to support the development:

- [Donate](@/donate/index.md)! Every dollar or euro counts and helps us to pay for servers and scale.
- Report bugs and share ideas on our [GitHub](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/issues)
  or via [email](mailto:support@organicmaps.app).
- Help us to [fix bugs](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
  and do code reviews if you are a developer. Every fixed small issue makes someone happier.

  descriptions into your language.
