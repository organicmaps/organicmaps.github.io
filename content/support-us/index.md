Organic Maps is a free, open-source app. It is free from ads, it does not collect your personal information, and it is developed by a few enthusiasts with the help of the community.

There are different ways to support the development:

- [Donate](@/donate/index.md)! Every dollar or euro counts and helps us to pay for servers and scale.
- Report bugs and share ideas on our [GitHub][github] or via [email][email].
- Help us to [fix bugs][contributing] and do code reviews if you are a developer. Every fixed small issue makes someone happier.
- [Translate][translations] missing strings in the app's interface.
- Translate [App Store][translations_appstore] and [Android][translations_googleplay] descriptions into your language.
- [Translate][translations_website] our web site into your language.
- Join the [OpenStreetMap][openstreetmap] community and contribute to the maps data.
- Fix red cities found by our [public transport validator][public_transport_validator], for subways and light rails to work in the app.
- Support other users on [GitHub][issues], [Telegram][telegram_chat], [matrix][matrix], [Twitter][twitter], [Facebook][facebook], [Instagram][instagram].
- Tell everyone about Organic Maps. A bigger community is a stronger community.
- Rate us in [Google Play][googleplay], [Apple Store][appstore], [Huawei Appgallery][appgallery].
- Any help is welcome!

Our small team is very grateful for your feedback and support. Organic Maps would not be possible without our users ❤️.
