Remember that to search for a place in a specific area, you will need to download a relevant map and zoom in the map to that area, or your location should be near that area before you begin the search. For example, if you want to find a place in Vietnam and your location is somewhere else, you should download and open the map of Vietnam first, or explicitly mention the country (Vietnam) or desired city/town/village name in the search field.

In addition, the place may not have been added to the map yet at [OpenStreetMap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). If you want to help and improve the map, check [this guide](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Contribute_map_data) and add missing map information yourself.

If the place is displayed on the map in Organic Maps, but our search cannot find it, [report us](mailto:support@organicmaps.app) coordinates of the place and an example of your search request.
